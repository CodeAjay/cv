        1.Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes 
        name, address, phone, school, etc.
                                               
        2.Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
                                               
        3.Look for Website privacy policies. Know how your child’s information is treated.
